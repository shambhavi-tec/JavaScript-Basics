# JavaScript Basics – Part 1

This folder contains my first set of practice work in JavaScript.  
So far, I have covered:  
- Alerts & Prompts  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else-if`, `switch`)  
- Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
- A few small practice questions (in their respective HTML files)  

---

## 📌 Assignment
At the end, I completed an assignment where I solved various problems **without any assistance**.  
One interesting part → I had to **disable GitHub Copilot’s code completion** because it was predicting all the answers before I could think.  
I made a conscious choice to turn it off so I could actually work through the logic on my own.
