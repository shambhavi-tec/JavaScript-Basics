# JavaScript Basics ‚Äì Part 2

This folder contains my continued practice work in JavaScript.

So far, I have worked on:

- **String Methods:**  
  `trim()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `indexOf()`, Method chaining, `slice()`, `replace()`, and `repeat()`
  
- **Arrays:**  
  - Understanding how arrays in JavaScript differ from arrays in other programming languages  
  - Learning about array references and how they work  
  - Exploring and practicing array methods such as:  
    `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `indexOf()`, `includes()`, `concat()`, `reverse()`, `slice()`, `splice()`, and `sort()`
  
- **Practice & Assignment:**  
  - Completed multiple small practice questions during learning  
  - Worked on a final assignment to apply all the concepts  
  - Questions are present in the HTML files, and the answers/outputs can be viewed in the browser console
