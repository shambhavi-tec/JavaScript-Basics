# 📚 JavaScript Basics – My Learning Journey  

This repo is all about me practicing and documenting my **JavaScript learning journey** 🚀.  
I’ve organized everything into subfolders, each representing different stages of progress — from the most basic stuff to slightly advanced concepts.  

It’s not a polished project repo, but more of a **practice playground** where I try out code, make mistakes, fix them, and (hopefully) get better at JavaScript over time 😅.

## 🔎 What’s Inside?  

- Subfolders with small code snippets & examples  
- Step-by-step progress as I learn new topics  
- Covers basics first, then gradually builds up  
- Purely for **practice & learning** (not a full-fledged project)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists?  

- To **track my progress** in learning JS  
- To have a space where I can **experiment freely**  
- To share my journey with others who might be starting out too
